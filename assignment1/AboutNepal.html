<h3 id="History"style="color:green;"><i>History of Nepal</i></h3>
<div class="para">
<p>The first civilizations in Nepal, which flourished around the 6th century B.C. , were confined to the fertile Kathmandu Valley where the present-day capital of the same name is located. It was in this region that Prince Siddhartha Gautama was born in 563 B.C. Gautama achieved enlightenment and spawned Buddhism.
The history of Nepal has been influenced by its position in the Himalayas and its two neighbors , modern day India and China. Due to the "arrival of disparate settler" groups from outside through the ages, it is now a multiethnic, multiracial, multi <a href="#Culture">Culture</a>, multi religious, and multilingual country.
Nepal experienced a struggle for democracy in the 20th century. During the 1990s and until 2008, the country was in civil strife. A peace treaty was signed in 2008 and elections were held in the same year. In a historical vote for the election of the constituent assembly, Nepalese parliament voted to oust the monarchy in June 2008. Nepal became a federal republic and was formally renamed the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.</p>
